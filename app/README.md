# Brain Console

The control plane for the flow: one local daemon that watches every flow project on this
machine and serves a reconciled, live snapshot. The UI, a tray, a chat pane and an MCP server all
read that one shape. Node 24, TypeScript run as-is, no runtime dependencies.

## Run it
```bash
cd app && npm install
npm start -- --project /work/projects/foosbrawl            # one or more --project flags
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:7474/api/projects/foosbrawl/snapshot | jq .counts
curl -N http://127.0.0.1:7474/api/projects/foosbrawl/events  # server-sent events, one snapshot per change
```
Projects also come from `BRAIN_CONSOLE_PROJECTS` (colon separated roots) or
`~/.config/brain-console/projects.json` (`{"projects":[{"root":"…"}]}`). Every root must hold a
`.flow/config.yaml`, or the daemon refuses to start. It binds `127.0.0.1` only; `--token <t>` (or
`BRAIN_CONSOLE_TOKEN`) guards every route with `Authorization: Bearer <t>` or `?token=<t>`.

## Routes
| Route | What |
|---|---|
| `GET /healthz` | `{ok, projects}` |
| `GET /api/projects` | every project with its counts |
| `GET /api/projects/<id>/snapshot` | the current snapshot |
| `GET /api/projects/<id>/events` | SSE stream: `event: snapshot` on every change, a heartbeat every 15s |
| `POST /api/projects/<id>/refresh?source=<files\|git\|processes\|jobs\|board\|pulls>` | re-read one source now (all when omitted) |

## The snapshot
`daemon/src/snapshot.ts` is the contract. One `Snapshot` per project: `project`, `sources`
(when each source was read and whether it worked), `counts`, `attention` (what needs a human,
oldest first), `worktrees`, `items`, `gates`, `runs`, `agents`, `jobs`, `pulls`, `events` and
`disagreements`. Timestamps are ISO UTC; every age is seconds at `takenAt`, so a reader keeps
counting on its own clock between snapshots.

One status language, used by worktrees and items alike:

| State | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `running` | an unattended agent process (`claude -p`, `codex exec`) has its cwd in the worktree, or a live run record |
| `needs-you` | its item has a gate record in `.flow/gates` |
| `stale` | the branch is ≥ 20 commits behind its base, or the claim is ≥ 72h old with no run, agent or gate |
| `claimed` | claimed, idle, nothing waits on you |
| `free` | no claim |
| `outside` | the main worktree or one not in the pool |

Flags add detail without changing the state: `dirty`, `behind`, `stale-branch`, `idle`,
`dead-run` (a run record with no process), `agent-without-claim`, `session` (someone's interactive
host is open in the folder).

Every open pull request carries one state, the first that holds:

| PR state | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `draft` | a draft PR |
| `conflicts` | GitHub says it does not merge cleanly (`mergeable` `CONFLICTING` or merge state `DIRTY`) |
| `checks-failing` | a check failed: each check counted once, by its latest run (a queued re-run is the latest); a completed run counts as failed unless it ended `SUCCESS`, `NEUTRAL` or `SKIPPED` |
| `changes-requested` | the review decision is `CHANGES_REQUESTED`, or, with no review required, a latest review asks for changes |
| `checks-pending` | a check is still queued or running |
| `review-pending` | the repository requires an approval and has none yet |
| `approved` | approval is satisfied (approved, or no review required) but a review thread is unresolved, or GitHub does not let it merge yet (merge state `BLOCKED`, `BEHIND`, `UNKNOWN`, or `mergeable` not `MERGEABLE`) |
| `mergeable` | checks green, approval satisfied, no unresolved thread, `MERGEABLE`, merge state `CLEAN`, `HAS_HOOKS` or `UNSTABLE`: ready to merge |

A PR belongs to the item whose `pr` field names it (a number, or its URL compared without case or
scheme), else to the item claimed on its head branch unless the PR comes from a fork, and that
gives its worktree. `checks-failing`, `changes-requested` and `mergeable` each add an attention row
(`pr-failing`, `pr-changes-requested`, `pr-mergeable`), and `counts` carries `pullsFailing`,
`pullsChangesRequested` and `pullsMergeable`.

## Sources and cadence
| Source | How | Every |
|---|---|---|
| `files` | `.flow/config.yaml`, `gates/*.json`, `runs/*.json`, each pool worktree's `.flow/claim.json`, `events.log`, the plugin `.flow/plugin.sh` resolves | 30s, and at once on any change under `.flow` |
| `git` | `git worktree list`, per worktree ahead/behind the base, dirty files, last commit | 30s, and after a file change |
| `processes` | `ps` + `lsof` for `claude`/`codex` processes and their cwd | 10s |
| `jobs` | `scripts/jobs.sh status --json` from the project's flow plugin | 60s |
| `board` | `scripts/board.sh --json` (asks the tracker; tens of seconds on GitHub) | 120s |
| `pulls` | `gh pr list` for the open PRs of `github.repo`, then one `gh api graphql` for their unresolved review threads (the first 100 per PR); a project not on the github adapter, or without `github.repo`, reports `ok` with `error: "not applicable: …"` and is never read | 60s |

The daemon never writes to a project. The next slice adds actions: every button in the UI runs a
flow script through the daemon, which streams its output and logs it.

## Reconciliation
`daemon/src/reconcile.ts` is a pure function from the collected facts to the snapshot, with the
clock injected. It derives states, ages, the attention list and the disagreements between the seven
places flow state lives (claims, gate records, run records, the process list, issue labels and
state, the project card, pull requests): a run record with no process, an agent in a worktree
without a claim, a claim whose step differs from the issue, a gate record the labels do not show,
and an open item at step done that waits on a merge with no merge gate. That last rule takes the
best evidence there is: with pull requests read, the item's PR is in state `mergeable`; when the
`pulls` source was never read or does not apply, the issue state naming a PR is enough.

## Develop
```bash
npm run check      # tsc, then node --test
```
Tests use a fixture flow home under `daemon/test/fixtures` and a fake command runner, so no shell,
git or GitHub is touched. Test names are behavioural sentences and every assertion carries its
because-string, as the standards ask.
